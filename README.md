The name of our product is deceptiform, let us break it down. The first half of the name of the product comes from the movie transformers and the main villains in the same movie are called Decepticons which are humongous robots with autonomous interstellar technology.

 The second half is a simple word “Form” which in its entirety means a method to ease the process of exchange of information via a set of input fields. 

Lets us Fuse these two words together in an attempt to explain a product. Deceptiform, in other words, means the automation of filling of cumbersome forms which we often find ourselves stuck with, leading to either just staring at the complexly constructed pieces of papers or paying huge loads of money to some professional to decode the form and help us fill it.

Lets us take an example to better understand the usability of the product. Let us say that you want to buy a piece of land and in order to do that you cant just simply smash a pile of cash on the desk and go on with your life celebrating the new purchase. 

On a more simpler alternative reality, you would first have to hire a lawyer to bring about all the paperwork and then you have to sit down multiple times throughout the week, paying for every sitting to that notorious lawyer, trying to decode that encrypted piece of paper that lawyers have carefully curated to make it unreadable to a normal person in order to promote their business model. Enjoy hassle-free documentation with Deceptiform.

Secondly, if you were in a documentation sector you would easily realise that an agreement or a formal doc could go up to 1000-2000 pages in length.

 In the face of such a situation, a legal professional or a documentation personal just simply go skimming through the document since they won't be sitting down reading a whole of 2000 pages for every single customer, this assures a guarantee of atleast missing out on atleast a few details, but not with deceptiform. Enjoy a 100% error-free documentation and form filling in lightening fast terms. 

Additionally, we are all familiar with the scams that go around these paper works. There could be an insurance paper amongst the other pile of papers, and the lawyer could make you sign with a blind eye everywhere. The only thing you need to keep a blind eye on is the quality and safety of Deceptiform.

Who is to save us amongst such dismay?
Now, what if I told you that there was free service that would automatically fill the whole legal document just based on a few questions. 

All you need to do is enter the form template which is quite freely available on the internet and sit back while our service using NLP and certain algorithms, constructs a small questionnaire about the details which it will need from you to fill the form. 

Just answer a few super simple straightforward question and witness our product smarty fill up the whole document. BOOM, enjoy your document hassle-free.  

Let's not limit this application to legal documents, we come across such documents on very frequent occasions, for instance when you wanted to Join Vellore Institute of Technology – Vellore, you were handed hundreds of papers to fill and a thousand places to sign, or whenever you are looking to join a new organisation as an employee or whenever you end up going to the hospital or the notary.

 Be it a birthday invite or a simple non-disclosure agreement, simply enter the form template and enjoy the end product while you sip on your morning tea.

This future of the project aims to make a central database of all the forms that are generally used in the country and make it a cakewalk to fill such forms. Giving a time benefit of a magnitude much greater than that of current standards.
Save time, save money, and save the effort, go deceptiform.


## Getting Started

It's quite simple, just follow the following steps.

Start with cloning the repository in the desired directory :

```
git clone <http url>
```

Download and install node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Check if all the dependencies specified in the ```package.json``` are installed.

## Prerequisites

All you need is a knack for learning.

If you are just getting started with GitHub then I recommended you to read [this](https://github.com/wimpywarlord/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md) document. This is for when you look forward to making small changes and pull requests.

In case you want a comprehensive understanding of GitHub and want to become a long term contributor to this project, I recommend reading [this]( https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) document.

## Installing

Optionally I recommend you to download **Sublime text** 3.Its an amazing free editor from [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). 

Download and install node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Deployment

Open the **command prompt** in the base folder of the repository and type in the command : 

```
node app.js
```

Open your browser and type in the URL : 

```
localhost:8000
```

It could be the case where your port number 8000 is already occupied , in that case just simply change the listen port in the app.js to any other number such as 5000 , 9000 etc.
